 * substituting `{{PLACEHOLDER}}`s. The point is not templating for its own
 * sake — it is that the shared parts of six skills stop being six copies.
 *
 * Before this existed, the "chat in the project's language" rule was written
 * three different ways in three skills, and "never claim green without output"
 * lived in two. That is how a skill suite rots: not by anyone being wrong, but
 * by six copies drifting apart one honest edit at a time.
 *
 * Every resolver reads a source of truth that already exists — CLAUDE.md for
 * the invariants, package.json for the gate commands, docs/rules/ for the rules
 * map. So a skill cannot describe a gate command the repo does not have.
