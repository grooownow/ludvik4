/**
 * SessionStart hook: tell the user, once a day at most, if a newer Liftkit
 * template has shipped.
 *
 * Whatever this prints on stdout is injected into the session as context, so
 * the agent can relay it. That is the whole point — the notice reaches a buyer
 * who would never think to read a CHANGELOG, at the one moment they are looking.
 *
 * Everything here fails open and silent. No network, a private template they
 * can't reach, a git that isn't installed, a throttle file it can't write — all
 * resolve to "print nothing and exit 0". A startup hook that errors, hangs, or
 * nags is a hook the user disables, and then it protects no one.
