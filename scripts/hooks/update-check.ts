/**
 * The version-comparison brain of the update check, as pure functions.
 *
 * The problem this solves is discoverability, not networking: a buyer knows two
 * commands and how to talk to the agent. They have no reason to open CHANGELOG,
 * so a new release is invisible to them. The fix is to surface it where they
 * already are — one line at the start of a session — and the only judgement
 * that needs testing is "is the remote newer than what I have, and should I
 * even ask right now?". That is here; the IO (git, clock, files) lives in
 * session-update-check.ts and is injected, so this stays deterministic.
