/**
 * The hard invariants of CLAUDE.md, as code.
 *
 * Until now every invariant was prose: the agent was *asked* not to add a
 * network call to middleware, and a reviewer was asked to catch it if it did.
 * These functions are the same rules expressed as predicates over a proposed
 * edit, so a `PreToolUse` hook can refuse the write instead of regretting it.
 *
 * Two deliberate design choices:
 *
 * 1. **Only the added text is inspected.** An `Edit` carries `new_string`; a
 *    pre-existing violation elsewhere in the file is not this edit's fault and
 *    blocking on it would make the file uneditable.
 * 2. **`deny` is reserved for patterns with no legitimate form.** A heuristic
 *    that can be wrong (zod coverage) returns `ask`, which surfaces the
 *    concern and lets the human overrule it. A rule that cries wolf gets
 *    switched off, and then it enforces nothing.
