// ship its zod schema (and every server env key name) into the browser
// bundle for the sake of one public key. Raw `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_*`

// reason, and it's the only thing Next.js statically inlines for

/**
 * PostHog analytics slot — OFF by default.
 *
 * With no `NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY` set, this renders `children` only:
 * no `posthog-js` import ever executes, so no PostHog code runs and no
 * network calls are made. Buyers turn it on by setting the env var.
 *
 * The `posthog-js` import is dynamic (inside `useEffect`, behind the key
 * check) rather than a static top-level import specifically so bundlers
 * split it into its own async chunk that is only *requested* when a key
 * is present — a static import would still ship the library in the
 * initial bundle regardless of the runtime `if` guard. Verified in
 * task-8-report.md by inspecting `.next` build output with and without
 * the key set.
