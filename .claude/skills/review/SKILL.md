description: Adversarial review of the current diff (or a given commit range) — attacks the diff to find bugs, security holes, and rule violations, with one lens per docs/rules file plus spec-conformance, test-honesty, and security lenses. Reports verified findings by severity with file:line and offers to fix Critical/Major ones. Use when the user asks to review changes, to check whether a diff is safe, or to vet commits before opening a PR ("/review", "review this diff"); or when the feature skill hands off a large or risky diff.

# Review

Attack the diff like a reviewer who wants to find the bug, then report only
what survives verification. This is the adversarial pass the rules files
delegate to for everything marked `(convention — checked at review)`.

## Ground rules

<!-- Generated from the shared preamble (scripts/lib/codegen.ts). Edit it there, not here. -->

- **Language:** chat with the user in the project's chat language
  (`docs/manifest.md` → _Chat language_; falls back to the language of the
  user's messages while unset). Every artifact that lives in the repo — code,
  docs, commit messages — is English.
- **Evidence, not adjectives.** Never report a command as green without quoting
  the line that proves it. "It should pass" is not a result, and the word
  _should_ in a status line is a red flag about your own honesty.
- **The hard invariants** (`CLAUDE.md`), which a `PreToolUse` hook
  (`scripts/hooks/pretooluse.ts`) enforces at the moment of the write — do not
  design around them, and do not treat a hook denial as a puzzle to route
  around:

  1. No internal `<a href>`/`window.location` navigation — always `<Link>`.
  2. No network/db call in `src/middleware.ts` — the JWT check stays local.
  3. No feature ships without a test proven able to fail.
  4. Every server action/route validates input with `zod` before use.
  5. Every commit follows Conventional Commits (one exception: `/liftoff`
     onboarding commits — see `docs/rules/git.md`).

- **Read the rule that governs the step you are on, at the moment you reach it** —
  not from memory, and not all of them up front:

  - `docs/rules/architecture.md` — new routes, feature slices, data access, import direction, schema changes.
  - `docs/rules/definition-of-done.md` — every change, without exception — this is the standing bar, and the one rules file that is never out of scope.
  - `docs/rules/docs.md` — any change to `docs/`, `CLAUDE.md`/`AGENTS.md`, or a decision worth remembering across sessions. Docs are the interface between agent sessions — stale docs are worse than missing ones.
  - `docs/rules/frontend.md` — any page, component, mutation, or loading state — responsiveness is an invariant here, not a nice-to-have.
  - `docs/rules/git.md` — every commit, branch, and merge in this repo.
  - `docs/rules/security.md` — every server action, route handler, env var, and auth-adjacent change — this is baseline, not opt-in.
  - `docs/rules/sources.md` — any line of code or prose that asserts how a third-party framework, library, or API behaves.
  - `docs/rules/testing.md` — every code change — no feature is done without tests.

- **Verify before reporting.** Re-read the actual code for every candidate
  finding; a claim you didn't confirm against the file is a false positive —
  drop it. Fewer, verified findings beat a long speculative list.
- **The diff is the scope, the codebase is the context.** Only changed code
  earns findings, but read enough surrounding code to judge it fairly.
- **Findings, then consent.** Report first; touch code only after the user
  (or the calling skill's user) says yes to a fix.
- **This is the post-hoc gate.** If the diff's risky decisions were never
  cross-examined in flight, that is a finding, not an excuse to do it here —
  name it and point the caller at the `doubt` skill for next time.

## Step 1 — Establish the diff

- Range given (commits, `main...HEAD`, files) → use it.
- On a feature branch → `git diff main...HEAD` **plus** uncommitted work
  (`git diff` and `git status` — untracked new files count).
- On `main` itself → review the uncommitted working tree; if it's clean,
  ask the user which range to review (one question).

Then load the context: if the change has a spec in `docs/specs/`, read it —
it defines "correct" for the conformance lens below.

## Step 2 — Run the lenses (one deliberate pass each)

For each rules lens: read the rule file first, then sweep the diff against
it — including the file's own "Gates (self-check before done)" checklist.

1. **Spec conformance** — every spec requirement and test scenario is
   covered by the diff; nothing out-of-scope snuck in; edge cases from the
   spec's Edge cases section are handled. No spec → check against the
   user's stated intent and say the review ran spec-less.
2. **`docs/rules/architecture.md`** — slice shape, import direction, thin
   routes, db access path, migration discipline.
3. **`docs/rules/frontend.md`** — the five responsiveness rules, tokens
   (no raw colors), loading states, a11y basics.
4. **`docs/rules/testing.md`** — right level per the decision table,
   anti-flaky rules, factories reused.
5. **`docs/rules/security.md`** — see the dedicated security lens below.
6. **`docs/rules/git.md`** — commit format/cadence, nothing staged that
   the "What NOT to commit" list bans.
7. **`docs/rules/docs.md`** — behavior/structure changed → manifest/roadmap/
   spec status updated; a real decision made → ADR present.
8. **Test honesty** — the lens testing.md explicitly delegates here: for
   each new behavior, would these tests FAIL if the behavior were broken or
   absent? Hunt assertion-free tests, over-mocked integration tests, tests
   that restate the implementation, and missing evidence that a new test
   was proven able to fail.
9. **Security** — every new action/route validates raw input with `zod`
   before use; protected surfaces call `requireUser()`; redirects from user
   input go through `safeCallbackUrl()`; no secret literal anywhere in the
   diff; new env vars did all three (schema + `.env.example` + env test).
10. **`docs/rules/sources.md`** — every third-party API the diff newly
    depends on is either backed by a lookup in this session's transcript or
    cited in an ADR; nothing rests on the model's memory of an older version.

## Step 3 — The confidence gate (before any finding is written down)

Score every candidate finding 1-10 on one question only: **how sure are you
that this is real?** The score is not a severity and not a priority — a
cosmetic typo you can see with your own eyes is a 10.

The gate: **if you cannot quote the verbatim line from the file that motivates
the finding, the score is capped at 5, and anything below 6 is dropped from the
report.** Not softened, not filed under "possible issues" — dropped.

Do not work around this by inventing a confident-sounding 7 for a finding you
have not verified. That defeats the entire gate, and it is the specific failure
this step exists to catch: the finding that reads plausibly, cites a real file,
and describes a bug that is not there. A reviewer who reports four real bugs is
worth more than one who reports four real bugs and six imagined ones, because
the second reviewer has to be checked.

The quote is the evidence. `file:line` alone is a pointer, not a proof — you
can produce a plausible line number for a bug that does not exist, and you will
if you are guessing.

## Step 4 — Report findings by severity

Post to chat, grouped, each with `file:line`, **the quoted line**, the violated
rule or spec section, and a concrete fix:

- **Critical** — broken/incorrect behavior, a security hole, data loss, or
  a false-green test (a test that passes with the feature broken).
- **Major** — a rules violation with real consequences: wrong test level or
  missing mandated test, cross-feature deep import, missing loading state,
  spec requirement not implemented, docs actualization skipped, a Definition
  of Done item skipped (docs not actualized, runtime never observed).
- **Minor** — naming, comment drift, style nits worth a line each.

Nothing found → say exactly that, and name the lenses that ran (a clean
report from ten lenses means something; "looks good" means nothing).

## Step 5 — Offer to fix

Offer to fix Critical and Major findings now — one question, listing what
would change. On consent: fix, rerun the gate that covers each fix
(`pnpm lint` / `pnpm test` — or hand back to the `feature` skill's flow if
this review was called from there), and confirm each finding closed with
command output. Minors: list them; fix only if asked.

## Step 6 — Record (optional)

Only if the user wants a persistent record, write the findings to
`docs/code-review/<YYYY-MM-DD>-<slug>.md` (create the directory if
missing): scope reviewed, findings by severity, resolution status per
finding. Run `pnpm format` before committing it (per `docs/rules/git.md`,
as a `docs:` commit). Default is chat-only — no file litter.

## Common rationalizations

| Rationalization                                             | Reality                                                                                                                                                      |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| "This looks wrong, I'll flag it just in case"               | An unverified finding is a false positive. Re-read the file; if you cannot quote the line, drop it — that is the confidence gate, not a suggestion.          |
| "I'm fairly sure, so that's a 7"                            | You are scoring your certainty, not your hope. No quoted line means the score is capped at 5, and a 5 does not get reported. Inventing a 7 defeats the gate. |
| "I'll report it as a 'possible issue' to be safe"           | "Possible issue" is a suppressed finding wearing a hat. It costs the reader the same verification time as a real one. Drop it or prove it.                   |
| "Nothing found, so: looks good to me"                       | Name the lenses that ran. A clean report from ten named lenses means something; "looks good" means nothing.                                                  |
| "The test passes, so it covers the behavior"                | That is the test-honesty lens, not a reason to skip it. Ask whether the test would fail if the behavior were absent.                                         |
| "I found the bug, let me just fix it"                       | Findings, then consent. Fixing before the user has seen the finding destroys the record of what was wrong.                                                   |
| "The diff is small, one pass over all ten lenses is enough" | Each lens is one deliberate pass, and each starts by reading its rules file. Reading ten files once and sweeping once is one lens, not ten.                  |

## Red flags

- A finding without `file:line`
- A finding with a `file:line` but no quoted line — the pointer without the proof
- A finding scored 6+ that you never opened the file to confirm
- A "possible issues" or "worth a look" section at the bottom of the report
- A finding whose rule citation is a rules _file_ but not a _section_
- Code changed before the user answered the Step 4 question
- Minor findings fixed unasked
