# Feature

Take one feature from name to merged, tested, documented slice. Input is a
feature name, a description, or a path to an existing spec. The flow is
linear (Step 1 → 8); create a todo per step before starting.

## Ground rules

<!-- Generated from the shared preamble (scripts/lib/codegen.ts). Edit it there, not here. -->

- **Language:** chat with the user in the project's chat language
  (`docs/manifest.md` → _Chat language_; falls back to the language of the
  user's messages while unset). Every artifact that lives in the repo — code,
  docs, commit messages — is English.
- **Evidence, not adjectives.** Never report a command as green without quoting
  the line that proves it. "It should pass" is not a result, and the word
  _should_ in a status line is a red flag about your own honesty.
- **The hard invariants** (`CLAUDE.md`), which a `PreToolUse` hook
  (`scripts/hooks/pretooluse.ts`) enforces at the moment of the write — do not
  design around them, and do not treat a hook denial as a puzzle to route
  around:

  1. No internal `<a href>`/`window.location` navigation — always `<Link>`.
  2. No network/db call in `src/middleware.ts` — the JWT check stays local.
  3. No feature ships without a test proven able to fail.
  4. Every server action/route validates input with `zod` before use.
  5. Every commit follows Conventional Commits (one exception: `/liftoff`
     onboarding commits — see `docs/rules/git.md`).

- **Read the rule that governs the step you are on, at the moment you reach it** —
  not from memory, and not all of them up front:

  - `docs/rules/architecture.md` — new routes, feature slices, data access, import direction, schema changes.
  - `docs/rules/definition-of-done.md` — every change, without exception — this is the standing bar, and the one rules file that is never out of scope.
  - `docs/rules/docs.md` — any change to `docs/`, `CLAUDE.md`/`AGENTS.md`, or a decision worth remembering across sessions. Docs are the interface between agent sessions — stale docs are worse than missing ones.
  - `docs/rules/frontend.md` — any page, component, mutation, or loading state — responsiveness is an invariant here, not a nice-to-have.
  - `docs/rules/git.md` — every commit, branch, and merge in this repo.
  - `docs/rules/security.md` — every server action, route handler, env var, and auth-adjacent change — this is baseline, not opt-in.
  - `docs/rules/sources.md` — any line of code or prose that asserts how a third-party framework, library, or API behaves.
  - `docs/rules/testing.md` — every code change — no feature is done without tests.

- **Branching:** non-trivial work happens on a feature branch off `main`,
  merged only after a green `verify` run (`docs/rules/git.md`).
- **Commit cadence:** conventional commit after every green step — this is
  the resume point if the session drops. Run `pnpm format` before EVERY
  commit (lefthook's `prettier --check` rejects unformatted files).
- **STOP conditions:**
  - Spec ambiguity that changes what you'd build → ask the user **one
    question** and wait; never guess on a fork in behavior.
  - A gate still red after **2 honest fix attempts** on the same failure →
    stop, report the exact command output and current state, ask how to
    proceed. Never claim green without output; never skip a gate.

## Resume protocol (run before Step 1, every time)

A dropped session is the normal case, not the exception, and the cost of
guessing where you left off is redoing work or — worse — skipping a step
because the code looks finished. Reconstruct state from the repo, never from
memory of the conversation:

1. `git log --oneline -20` — the commit cadence below means each green step
   left a commit. The last one names the last completed step.
2. `git status` — uncommitted work means a step was interrupted mid-flight.
   Finish or discard it before starting anything new; never build on top of a
   half-step.
3. Is there a `docs/specs/<slug>.plan.md`? Read it. Its last line tells you
   whether planning ever finished (see Step 2's sentinel). A plan whose last
   line is not `NO UNRESOLVED DECISIONS` means Step 2 is where you resume —
   not Step 3, however much implemented code you find lying around.
4. Re-verify the **Done when** of the last completed step before trusting it.
   A commit is evidence that a step ended, not that it ended correctly.

Nothing found → this is a fresh feature; start at Step 1.

## Step 1 — Spec (approval gate)

1.0. `git switch -c feat/<slug>` — create the feature branch off `main`
before the first commit (branch naming convention: `feat/<slug>`,
matching the feature's slug).

1. Resolve the spec: given a path, read it; otherwise look for
   `docs/specs/<feature-slug>.md`.
2. **Spec exists:** confirm status is `approved`. If `draft`, show the user
   a one-paragraph digest and get approval first (update status on yes).
3. **No spec:** write one from `docs/templates/spec.md` into
   `docs/specs/<feature-slug>.md` (create `docs/specs/` if missing). Every
   section filled; **Data model** and **Test scenarios** concrete (read
   `docs/rules/testing.md`'s decision table before writing scenarios).
   Show the digest, iterate until the user approves, set status `approved`.
4. Set status to `in progress` when implementation starts.

**Done when:** approved spec exists. Commit: `docs: spec for <slug>`.

## Step 2 — Plan the slice touch-points

Read `docs/rules/architecture.md`, then write the plan to
`docs/specs/<slug>.plan.md`. It stays short — a map, not a document:

- `src/features/<slug>/` — `index.ts` (public API), `*-action.ts`, UI
  components, colocated tests.
- Route files under `src/app/` (thin: parse → call feature → render), plus
  `loading.tsx` if the route has an async data dependency.
- Schema change? Name the tables (→ migration path in Step 3).
- New env var? Name it (→ the three-part rule in `docs/rules/security.md`).
- **Open decisions** — every fork in behavior you cannot settle from the spec.

The plan exists for two reasons, and neither is ceremony. It is the resume
point if the session drops between Step 2 and Step 8 (`git log` tells you the
last green step; the plan tells you what you were going to do next). And it is
where an open decision has to be _written down_ rather than quietly resolved by
whichever guess you were already leaning toward.

### The completion sentinel

The plan file's last line is exactly:

```
NO UNRESOLVED DECISIONS
```

Write it only when the Open decisions list is empty — every fork either
answered by the spec or asked of the user and answered by them. If a decision
is still open, the last line names it instead, and you do not proceed to Step 3.

Then **read the file back** (`tail -1 docs/specs/<slug>.plan.md`) before moving
on. That is not paranoia about the filesystem — it is the one cheap check that
catches the failure this step exists to prevent: reaching the end of planning
with an unresolved fork and carrying on anyway, because by then the fork feels
settled. If the last line is not the sentinel, the plan is not done.

**Done when:** `docs/specs/<slug>.plan.md` exists, matches the spec's Scope, and
its final line is `NO UNRESOLVED DECISIONS`. Commit: `docs: plan for <slug>`.

## Step 3 — Implement as a slice

Follow the exemplars, not improvisation:

- Before writing a line that depends on a third-party API you have not
  verified this session, read `docs/rules/sources.md` and look it up.
- Server actions copy the shape of
  `src/features/profile/update-name-action.ts`: `requireUser()` →
  `zod` `safeParse` → typed `{ ok }` result → write scoped to the user.
- Mutating UI copies `src/features/profile/profile-form.tsx`
  (`useOptimistic` + `useActionState`). Read `docs/rules/frontend.md`
  before any UI work — tokens only, `<Link>` only, loading states.
- Cross-slice imports only via a feature's `index.ts`; keep routes thin
  (`pnpm lint` enforces the boundaries).
- Schema change: edit `src/db/schema.ts` → `pnpm db:generate` → **read the
  generated SQL** → `pnpm db:migrate`; never edit an applied migration.
  Extend `src/db/factories.ts` and `scripts/seed.ts` for each new entity
  (`docs/rules/testing.md`, Factories section).
- Before an applied migration, a change to `src/middleware.ts`, or anything
  touching the auth boundary, run the **`doubt`** skill on the decision —
  one bounded adversarial cycle while it is still cheap to change course.

**Done when:** the slice compiles and `pnpm lint` is green. Commit each
coherent green step (e.g. `feat(<slug>): schema and migration`).

## Step 4 — Tests (mandatory, no exceptions)

No feature ships without tests — this is a hard invariant, not a step to
negotiate away.

1. Read `docs/rules/testing.md`; place each spec Test scenario at the level
   its decision table dictates (unit / component / integration / e2e).
2. **Prove each new test can fail:** break the subject or the assertion,
   watch it fail for the right reason, restore, watch it pass. Report that
   you did this — an unproven test doesn't count.
3. Obey the anti-flaky rules and false-green bans (no sleeps, no
   assertion-free tests, no mocked-db integration tests).

**Done when:** `pnpm test` green with the new tests in, can-fail proven.
Commit: `test(<slug>): <scenarios covered>`.

## Step 5 — Gates

Run the **`verify`** skill: the full sequence
(`pnpm lint && pnpm test && pnpm test:e2e && pnpm build`) plus its browser
smoke of the surfaces this feature changed. Fix and rerun until green,
within the STOP budget above.

**Done when:** verify reports every gate PASS with evidence.

## Step 6 — Self-review

Walk `git diff main...HEAD` against three things: the spec, the standing
`docs/rules/definition-of-done.md` checklist, and the "Gates (self-check
before done)" section of every rules file this slice touched. Fix what you
find, rerun the affected gate.

If the diff is large (> ~300 lines) or touches auth, schema, or security
boundaries, run the **`review`** skill instead — its ten lenses are
stricter than a self-check — and resolve all Critical/Major findings.

**Done when:** self-review (or `review`) is clean; fixes committed.

## Step 7 — Doc actualization

Per `docs/rules/docs.md`'s actualization rule:

- Spec status → `shipped`.
- `docs/roadmap.md` — move the feature out of Now.
- `docs/manifest.md` — update if domain entities or key URLs changed.
- A real decision made along the way (library pick, deliberate rule
  deviation) → draft `docs/decisions/<NNNN>-<slug>.md` from
  `docs/templates/decision.md`; the user approves it.

**Done when:** docs match reality. Commit: `docs(<slug>): actualize`.

## Step 8 — Finish

Merge the feature branch back to `main` per `docs/rules/git.md` (only after
Step 5's green verify; never push a red `main`). Then hand over in chat:
what shipped, the evidence line from verify, and what's next in
`docs/roadmap.md`.

## Common rationalizations

| Rationalization                                                     | Reality                                                                                                                                              |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "This change is too small to need a test"                           | Invariant 3 has no size threshold. A change too small to test is a change too small to be a feature — fold it into one that is.                      |
| "I'll write the spec after the code, it'll be more accurate"        | Then it documents what you built, not what was wanted. The spec is the approval gate precisely because it comes first.                               |
| "The test passes, so it's testing the behavior"                     | Only if you watched it fail for the right reason. An unproven test is decoration; Step 4 requires the proof and requires you to report it.           |
| "Gates are green, skip the browser smoke"                           | `tsc` proves types, not that the page renders. The smoke step exists because green gates have shipped blank pages before.                            |
| "The gate is flaky, I'll just rerun it"                             | Two honest fix attempts, then STOP and report. A gate you rerun until it passes is a gate you have disabled.                                         |
| "I'll merge now and actualize the docs after"                       | The docs commit is Step 7 for a reason: after the merge, nobody comes back.                                                                          |
| "The user is waiting, I'll self-review instead of running `review`" | A > ~300-line diff or a touch to auth, schema, or a security boundary is exactly when a self-check misses things. That is what the threshold is for. |

## Red flags

- A commit that adds a feature and its test in one commit, with no evidence the test was ever red
- A spec written and approved in the same message that implements it
- "Should pass" or "should render" anywhere in a completion report
- The feature branch merged while a gate is red or unrun
