description: Curates the project's cross-session memory in docs/learnings.jsonl — appends one durable learning at a time (a pitfall already paid for, a stated user preference, a non-obvious constraint), searches what earlier sessions wrote down, and garbage-collects the store: an entry whose referenced files vanished is stale, an entry a newer note contradicts under the same key is superseded, and nothing is deleted without asking first. Use when the user says remember this, asks what past sessions learned, or wants the learnings file pruned; use after a session pays for a lesson that the codebase does not already record on its own.

# Learn

A model's context dies at the end of the session. The repo's does not. This
skill is the narrow bridge between them: a file of learnings that a future
session can trust because this one is willing to delete from it.

The store is `docs/learnings.jsonl` — one JSON object per line, English, in
the repo, in the diff, reviewable like code. It is small on purpose. A
learnings file that grows monotonically becomes a file of lies, and a lie the
agent reads at the top of every session is worse than no memory at all: it
arrives with the same authority as the truth sitting next to it.

## Ground rules

<!-- Generated from the shared preamble (scripts/lib/codegen.ts). Edit it there, not here. -->

- **Language:** chat with the user in the project's chat language
  (`docs/manifest.md` → _Chat language_; falls back to the language of the
  user's messages while unset). Every artifact that lives in the repo — code,
  docs, commit messages — is English.
- **Evidence, not adjectives.** Never report a command as green without quoting
  the line that proves it. "It should pass" is not a result, and the word
  _should_ in a status line is a red flag about your own honesty.

- **Never rewrite the store silently.** Appending is yours to do. Deleting is
  the user's to approve. Every prune shows its candidates first.

## The record

```json
{
  "key": "pglite-concurrency",
  "insight": "PGlite instances do not tolerate concurrent test files; the integration project is pinned to one worker.",
  "refs": ["vitest.config.ts"],
  "date": "2026-07-12",
  "source": "feature"
}
```

- **`key`** — a kebab-case slug naming _the subject_, not the verdict.
  `pglite-concurrency`, never `pglite-is-single-threaded`. This is the join
  key of the whole design: a later session that changes its mind about the
  subject can only be detected as a contradiction if it agrees on what the
  subject is called.
- **`insight`** — one actionable sentence. If a future session cannot do
  anything differently because of it, it is not an insight.
- **`refs`** — the repo-relative files the insight depends on. This is what
  gives the record an expiry date. No refs, no mechanical expiry — which is
  correct for a preference and wrong for a claim about code. **A learning
  about code with an empty `refs` array is a learning that will never be
  garbage-collected.** Fill it in.
- **`date`**, **`source`** — written by the tool, not by you.

## Recording a learning

Do not reach for this on your own after every task. Record when:

- **A pitfall was paid for.** Something cost this session real time, and the
  cause was not discoverable from the code alone.
- **The user stated a preference.** Explicitly, and it generalizes past the
  current task.
- **A non-obvious constraint surfaced.** A library, an environment, or an
  ordering that behaves against expectation, where the code shows _what_ but
  never _why_.

Do **not** record anything the repo already records — a duplicate is not free,
it is a second copy that will drift from the first and then contradict it:

| You are about to write down  | It already lives in                        |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| How the code is structured   | The code. And `docs/rules/architecture.md` |
| What changed and when        | Git history                                |
| A rule the agent must follow | `docs/rules/*.md` — put it _there_         |
| A hard invariant             | `CLAUDE.md`                                |
| What the feature does        | The spec, `docs/specs/`                    |
| What is next                 | `docs/roadmap.md`                          |
| A fact you have not verified | Nowhere. Verify it, then decide            |

The test: **would a competent engineer with the repo open in front of them
still not know this?** If they would know it, do not write it.

Then append. `date` and `source` are filled in by the tool — never pass a date
you remembered:

```
pnpm exec tsx scripts/learnings.ts add \
  --key pglite-concurrency \
  --insight "PGlite instances do not tolerate concurrent test files; the integration project is pinned to one worker." \
  --refs vitest.config.ts \
  --source feature
```

## Reviewing what is already known

```
pnpm exec tsx scripts/learnings.ts list
```

Read it before recording — if the key already exists, you are either
duplicating it (say nothing) or contradicting it (record the new one; the
prune step will surface the pair). Read it at the start of a session that
touches an area a past session left a note about.

## Pruning

The store garbage-collects on two checks, and neither of them requires
understanding English — which is the point. Anything that needed judgement to
run is a thing that would quietly never get run:

- **STALE** — a file in `refs` no longer exists. Whatever the learning taught,
  it taught it about code that is gone.
- **CONFLICT** — a newer record under the same key says something different.
  Both cannot be current. The newer one wins.

```
pnpm exec tsx scripts/learnings.ts check
```

Then, and only then:

1. **Show the candidates to the user.** Verbatim: reason, line, key, insight,
   and why it was flagged.
2. **Judge each one out loud, and say when the machine is wrong.** STALE often
   means a file _moved_ and the insight is intact — that is a re-ref, not a
   delete. A CONFLICT sometimes means the two records were never about the
   same subject and one of them is mis-keyed.
3. **Ask.** One decision per candidate. "Prune all N?" is not a question, it
   is a nudge toward a rubber stamp.
4. **Apply**, only for what was approved:

```
pnpm exec tsx scripts/learnings.ts prune --apply
```

`prune` deletes exactly what `check` printed and nothing else. If the user
wants to keep a flagged record, fix the record instead — re-ref it, or re-key
it — and the detector stops firing on its own. Editing the record to silence a
detector you have not understood is how the store starts lying.

Prune when a prune is cheap and honest — after a refactor that moved files,
before a handoff, when `check` is noisy. Not on a schedule nobody set.

## Relationship to the other skills

- `feature` — the natural producer. A slice that cost an hour to a constraint
  nobody could see ends with one record.
- `review` — a finding that keeps recurring across diffs is a learning, or,
  better, a missing line in a rules file.
- `doubt` — a disproved assumption is the highest-value learning there is: it
  is precisely the thing the code cannot tell you.
- `docs/rules/*.md` — the escalation path. A learning that turns out to be a
  **rule** does not belong here; it belongs in a rules file, where it is
  enforced rather than merely remembered. When you find yourself writing a
  fourth record around one subject, you have found a rule.

## Common rationalizations

| Rationalization                                | Reality                                                                                                                                         |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "I'll record it, it might be useful later"     | Every low-value record raises the cost of reading the useful ones. The bar is: a competent engineer with the repo open still would not know it. |
| "The store is getting big, prune it all"       | A bulk delete is not a prune, it is amnesia. One decision per candidate, or you will delete the one record that mattered.                       |
| "The detector flagged it, so it is dead"       | The detectors are mechanical, not right. STALE usually means a file _moved_. Re-ref it.                                                         |
| "I'll just fix the record so `check` is quiet" | Only after you understand why it fired. Silencing a detector you have not read is how the file starts lying.                                    |
| "This is important, I'll write a long entry"   | An insight that needs a paragraph is a spec, a rules line, or an ADR. One sentence, or it belongs somewhere else.                               |
| "I remember the date it happened"              | You do not. The tool dates the record; every conflict resolution hangs off that date.                                                           |
| "Pruning risks losing something"               | The store is in git. The risk runs the other way: an unpruned store is read and believed.                                                       |

## Red flags

- Recording a summary of what you just did — that is a commit message
- Recording a rule ("always validate with zod") instead of putting it in the
  rules file that enforces it
- A record about code with an empty `refs` array — it can never expire
- A `key` that states the verdict (`use-server-actions`) rather than the
  subject (`server-action-boundaries`) — nothing can ever contradict it
- Running `prune --apply` before showing the candidates
- Deleting a flagged record without reading its insight
- Hand-editing `docs/learnings.jsonl` instead of going through the tool
- More than a handful of records added in a single session — you are
  journalling, not learning
